In a town, there are n people labeled from 1 to n. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.

If the town judge exists, then:

The town judge trusts nobody.
Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.
You are given an array trust where trust[i] = [ai, bi] representing that the person labeled ai trusts the person labeled bi.

Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return -1 otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 2, trust = [[1,2]]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: 3
Example 3:

Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: -1
class Solution {
      public int findJudge(int N, int[][] trust) {
        int[] count = new int[N+1];
        for (int[] t: trust) {
            count[t[0]]--;
            count[t[1]]++;
        }
        for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
            if (count[i] == N - 1) return i;
        }
        return -1;
    }
